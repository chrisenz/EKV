The EKV 2.6 compact model was the first implementation of the EKV model in circuit simulators. It was initially developed by Prof. Matthias Bucher as part of his PhD thesis at EPFL under the supervision of Dr. F. Krummenacher and Prof. C. Enz. It was developed at the time when no other compact model covered the regions of moderate and weak inversion smoothly without any discontinuities. Although already old, it remains a good model for the design of low-power analog circuits in bulk CMOS technologies down to the 180nm node.

Because in EKV 2.6 the short-channel effects such as DIBL are not that accurate, Prof. Matthis Bucher developed EKV 3.0 as part of his PhD work. EKV 3.0 is a full featured compact model that includes all the effects for advanced bulk CMOS technologies.
