# The EKV 2.6 MOSFET Compact Model

![Prof. Matthias Bucher](/img/matthias.jpg)

The EKV 2.6 compact model was the first implementaion of the EKV model in circuit simulator. It was initially developped by Prof. Matthias Bucher as part of his PhD thesis at EPFL under the supervision of F. Krummenacher and C. Enz. It was devloepped at the time when no other compact model covered the regions of moderate and weak inversion smoothly without any discontunuities. Although already old, it remains a good model for the design of low-power analog circuits up to the about the 180nm technology node.

Because EKV 2.6 does not include all the short-channel effects such DIBL in an accurate. Prof. Matthis Bucher developped EKV 3 as part of his PhD work. EKV 3 is a full featured compact model that includes all the effects for advanced bulk technologies.
