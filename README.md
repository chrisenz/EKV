# The Enz-Krummenacher-Vittoz MOSFET Model

![The initial creators of the EKV model](/img/EKV.png)

EKV is a MOSEFT model that was initially developed at EPFL by Enz, Krummenacher and Vittoz for the design of low-power analog CMOS integrated circuits taking advantage of biasing the transistor at low current density in moderate and weak inversion. The creators of the EKV model are shown in the above photo with Prof. Christian Enz on the left, Dr. Fran√ßois Krummenacher in the center and Prof. Eric Vittoz on the rigth. This picture was taken at the farewell lecture of Prof. Enz on April 27 2023. We had to wait my farewell lecture to finally be able to take a photo with all three of us!

A short history of the EKV MOSEFT model can be found in the article [*A Short Story of the EKV MOS Transistor Model*](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4785778) which I wrote for the IEEE SSCS Newsletter dedicated to the work of Eric Vittoz.
