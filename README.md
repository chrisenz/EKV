EKV is a MOSEFT model that was initially developed at EPFL by Enz, Krummenacher and Vittoz for the design of low-power analog CMOS integrated circuits taking advantage of biasing the transistor at low current density in moderate and weak inversion. The creators of the EKV model are shown in the above photo with Prof. Christian Enz (the E) on the left, Dr. François Krummenacher (the K) in the center and Prof. Eric Vittoz (the V) on the right. This picture was taken at the farewell lecture of Prof. Enz on April 27 2023. We had to wait my farewell lecture to finally be able to take a photo with all three of us!

The name comes from the riginal publication ![*An Analytical MOS Transistor Model Valid in All Regions of Operation and Dedicated to Low-Voltage and Low-Current Applications*](/EKV2.6/docs/EKV_original_paper_1995_prepub.pdf).

A short history of the EKV MOSEFT model can be found in the article [*A Short Story of the EKV MOS Transistor Model*](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4785778) which I wrote for the IEEE SSCS Newsletter dedicated to the ![work of Eric Vittoz](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4785770&punumber=4563671).
